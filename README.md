## About the Project:
  This is a website to help manage personal finances (Helpnance = help + finance). There is still key features to be added (like login/signup and validation), so you can use the current site only to test the basic CRUD and visual functionalities.

  This website is only a study project for praticing React (along with the MERN stack), but i still plan to add the necessary features to make it at least actually usable.

## Personal notes on this project:
This was my first time using the vast majority of the above technologies, so I'm glad that I had few problems throughout this project and that I was able to learn a lot of new things. In this project I also tried to avoid looking for tutorials, limiting myself to researching problems only in the official documentation. I did this mainly because I wanted to improve my logic and problem solving. Unfortunately, I know that this may have resulted in not-so-clean and a little far from good practices, but I also know that these things are achieved with practice and experience, and that at the moment, improving my thinking is my priority. In the end, i manage to achieve really satisfying results on my own, so i'm glad i gave myself this little challenge.

React was also a bit easier to learn than i was expecting, and i'm excited for using this technology, along with Node, in my next projects.
